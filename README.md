# Turboclient
this is a turbowarp project that u can use for controlling a discord bot (and no, this isnt a fckin token stealers so dont worry abt gttin hacked)

hello! this is a message from the creator!, my name is note, and i create this out of boredom

this is what you must do to run this client properly

1. make sure u installed node.js
2. open ur cmd and change dirary (or whatever its supposed to spelled, im not 100% speaking english :P) to the path where u keep the file
3. type "node index.js"
4. open "TurboClient.html"
5. put what it asked for
6. boom!, you DONE

if you still thinks this is a token stealers
you can check the .sb3 file
(disclaimer: if u didnt do one of the steps, the program might wont working properly)
(disclaimer: the program itself might be crappy too cuz i havent tested it yet)
